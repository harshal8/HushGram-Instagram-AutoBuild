# Unified release uploader using native gh CLI with per-file retry and clobber.
#
# One rule for every metadata field: a field the caller did not name is not
# written. Absence means "leave it be" - never a claim of "empty" or "false".
# That conflation is what let the archive releases get their hand-written notes
# and pre-release badge overwritten on every build. When a release has to be
# created, gh's own defaults fill whatever was not named (name = tag, empty
# body), so a seed value can only ever reach a release that did not exist yet.
#
# Inputs (via env vars):
#   RELEASE_TAG / TAG     : Release tag name (required)
#   RELEASE_TITLE / TITLE : Release title. Unset leaves an existing name alone and
#                           lets gh name a new release after the tag.
#   RELEASE_BODY_FILE     : Path to a markdown notes file (e.g. build.md). Missing,
#                           empty or unset all count as "not named".
#   RELEASE_NOTES         : Inline notes string; consulted only if no body file was
#                           named. Empty means "not named", not "clear the body".
#   IS_PRERELEASE         : "true" marks a pre-release, "false" a full release,
#                           unset/empty leaves the state as it is. Any other value
#                           is rejected with exit 2 instead of being guessed at.
#   RELEASE_TARGET        : Target branch/commit for a NEW release (optional).
#                           Ignored when the release already exists.
#   UPLOAD_FILES          : Space-separated files/glob patterns (default: "./build/*")
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY     : owner/repo (required)
#   GH_TOKEN              : GitHub token (required)
#
# Assets are the deliberate exception to the rule above: the file list IS the
# caller's named intent, so there is no absence to interpret, and `gh release
# upload` refuses a name the release already has. Overwriting (--clobber) is
# therefore unconditional - without it a retried run dies on the file it had
# already pushed, which is the opposite of idempotent.
